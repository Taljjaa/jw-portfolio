            <p>
               My name is Jennifer Williams and I am a front-end developer in
               Seattle, Washington. I graduated with a degree in Zoology but
               quickly found my passion for programming after taking a Java
               class in my free time. When I'm not programming I enjoy watching
               esports, cuddling my dog, and rock climbing!
